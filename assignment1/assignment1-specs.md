## Notes

-   Highly recommended that you do both bonus/advanced features as they count to the assignment score
-   Ensure that the name of the files are correct
-   If you are working in a pair and have yet to declare so, do email in and state both admin number and full name.
-   Please understand what your project is doing so that you will be able to answer questions during the interview.
    -   Try putting into words what each part of the code is doing to check if you really do understand
    -   Failure to show understanding will result in loss of marks during interview
-   Submission deadline is 6th January 2020, 9am
